This is an unofficial snapshot of GLEW (2022-04-02): 
https://deac-ams.dl.sourceforge.net/project/glew/glew/snapshots/glew-20220402.tgz
This has been used because when glew 2.2.0 was initially added, there were no precompiled files
And it's a nasty 300MB download and code-generation pipeline to generate the source and headers

Here is the official glew 2.2.0 build (2021-01-20):
https://github.com/nigels-com/glew/releases/download/glew-2.2.0/glew-2.2.0.zip

The only difference is that the more recent snapshot contains additional extensions (none of which are used)
