# AsterTrack Viewer Client Software

This is AsterTrack Viewer, an reference viewer application intended to test the capabilities of all supported protocols.
It shares many similarities with the main AsterTrack Application as it has been derived from it.
Often-times, similarity to the main AsterTrack Application has been prioritised over creating a minimal example application, and as such there may be a lot of unused code.
For build instructions, refer to the AsterTrack Application instructions.
